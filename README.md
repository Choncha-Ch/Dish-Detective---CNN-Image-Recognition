# Dish-Detective---CNN-Image-Recognition
Image recognition program of Thai Food using Convolutional Neural Network called 'Dish Detective'. 

## Obejectives
1. Identify the name of the food in its local written and English pronunciation using a snapshot of the food
2. Provide the authentic spicy level
3. Provide the expected ingredients contained in the dish
   
## Summary
-  Thai Food Image Data Set: 16k images of 50 different Thai dishes and the mapping
-  Data Processing: Data cleaning (jpg & header), Rescaling, Preprocessing
-  Data Training: Design architectures (ex. filters) for  the convolutional neural network on TensorFlow
-  Prediction & Deployment: Predict the name of the dish of an input image on Streamlit
-  Showcase of the Dish Detective
